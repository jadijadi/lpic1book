#106.1 Install and configure X11
*Weight: 2*

Candidates should be able to install and configure X11.

### Key Knowledge Areas
- Verify that the video card and monitor are supported by an X server
- Awareness of the X font server
- Basic understanding and knowledge of the X Window configuration file

### Terms and Utilities:

- /etc/X11/xorg.conf
- xhost
- DISPLAY
- xwininfo
- xdpyinfo
- X

## History
This lesson is useless in modern life! Very strange but practically nothing in this lesson is used in real life because xorg.conf, xhost, ... is not used in any modern linux system anymore. Maybe they are here so you wont be shocked if you see an older linux. 

## X
The X Window System is a network transparent window system which runs on a wide range of computing and graphics machines; including practically ALL linux systems with graphical interfaces. It is also called X11 because of its version, X window system, X server, ...

## /etc/X11/xorg.conf
This is file X used to use for its configuration. In most cases this is automatically generated and works. Newer systems do not have this file so lets have a look at a xorg.conf I found on the Internet.


````
Section "Files"
	FontPath	"/usr/share/X11/fonts/misc"
	FontPath	"/usr/share/X11/fonts/100dpi/:unscaled"
	FontPath	"/usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi/:unscaled"
	FontPath	"/usr/share/X11/fonts/Type1"
	FontPath	"/usr/share/X11/fonts/100dpi"
	FontPath	"/usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi"
	FontPath	"/var/lib/defoma/x-ttcidfont-conf.d/dirs/TrueType"
EndSection
````

This part is about Fonts. When X-Server is running it needs these files. FontPaths tell X11 where fonts are. It also can refer to an IP running a font-server which is not common these days. Font servers used to be responsible of rendering fonts to be shown on clients but nowadays computers are fast and can render their own fonts. Font servers are going out of fashion! 

````
Section "Module"
	Load	"bitmap"
	Load	"ddc"
	Load	"dri"
	Load	"extmod"
	Load	"freetype"
	Load	"glx"
	Load	"int10"
	Load	"type1"
	Load	"vbe"
	Load	"dbe"
EndSection
````

These are modules. For example `glx` takes care of 3d graphical effects. We are asking X server to load so called modules.

Next we have to define our `InputDevice`s:

````
Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier	"Generic Keyboard"
	Driver		"kbd"
	Option		"CoreKeyboard"
	Option		"XkbRules"	"xorg"
	Option		"XkbModel"	"pc105"
	Option		"XkbLayout"	"us"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier	"Configured Mouse"
	Driver		"mouse"
	Option		"CorePointer"
	Option		"Device"		"/dev/input/mice"
	Option		"Protocol"		"ImPS/2"
	Option		"Emulate3Buttons"	"true"
	Option		"ZAxisMapping"		"4 5"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Synaptics Touchpad"
        Driver          "synaptics"
        Option          "SendCoreEvents"        "true"
        Option          "Device"                "/dev/psaux"
        Option          "Protocol"              "auto-dev"
        Option		"RightEdge"		"5000"
EndSection
````

As you can see each device has an `Identifier`, `Driver` and some options. We just defined a mouse, a keyboard and a touchpad and gave them some names.

````
Section "Device"
	Identifier	"ATI Technologies, Inc. Radeon Mobility 7500 (M7 LW)"
	Driver		"radeon"
	BusID		"PCI:1:0:0"
	Option		"DynamicClocks"	"on"
	Option		"CRT2HSync"	"30-80"
	Option		"CRT2VRefresh"	"59-75"
  	Option		"MetaModes"	"1024x768 800x600 640x480 1024x768+1280x1024"
EndSection
````

A graphic card is defined above. Again it has its identifies (name), its drivers and some options (like support resolutions, refresh rates, ...). This device needs a screen and a monitor:

> Note: The `vesa` points to a low resolution, always working driver. It is used for troubleshooting.

````
Section "Monitor"
	Identifier	"Generic Monitor"
	Option		"DPMS"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
	Identifier	"Screen0"
	Device		"Screen0 ATI Technologies, Inc. Radeon Mobility 7500 (M7 LW)"
	Monitor		"Generic Monitor"
	DefaultDepth	24
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth		1
		Modes		"1024x768"
	EndSubSection
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth		4
		Modes		"1024x768"
	EndSubSection
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth		8
		Modes		"1024x768"
	EndSubSection
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth		15
		Modes		"1024x768"
	EndSubSection
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth		16
		Modes		"1024x768"
	EndSubSection
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth		24
		Modes		"1024x768"
	EndSubSection
EndSection
````

Note how the screen uses the defined monitor (using its identifier "Generic Monitor") and defined graphic card. Also note the different color modes (say 24bit 1024x768). 

At the end we have to glue all of the above in one place as `ServerLayout`:

````
Section "ServerLayout"
	Identifier	"DefaultLayout"
	Screen		"Default Screen"
	InputDevice	"Generic Keyboard"
	InputDevice	"Configured Mouse"
	InputDevice	"Synaptics Touchpad"
EndSection
````

We have a layout with a screen and 3 input devices :)

> Note: Do not panic. It is enough for you to understand the `Section` and `EndSection` and a general understanding of the xorg.conf

## xwininfo
The `xwininfo` command is a window information utility for X. Run it and it waits for you to click on any window and gives you some information about that *window* like its size, position, color depth, ...

````
$ xwininfo 

xwininfo: Please select the window about which you
          would like information by clicking the
          mouse in that window.

## xhost
This command used to control the access to the X server. If you are on a X server and run `xhost` it tells you the access status. 

````
$ xhost
access control enabled, only authorized clients can connect
SI:localuser:jadi
````

As you can see only authorized clients can connect. To open it for all:

````
jadi@funlife:~$ xhost +
access control disabled, clients can connect from any host
````

And for closing it again:

````
jadi@funlife:~$ xhost -
access control enabled, only authorized clients can connect
````

Or open it for only one specific IP:

````
jadi@funlife:~$ xhost +192.168.42.85
192.168.42.85 being added to access control list
jadi@funlife:~$ xhost
access control enabled, only authorized clients can connect
INET:192.168.42.85	(no nameserver response within 5 seconds)
SI:localuser:jadi
````

### DISPLAY
This variable tell graphical program where to show their graphical output (where to draw their inputs). In normal cases this is set on my own machine:

````
$ echo $DISPLAY
:0
````

but if another X is listening to all IPs (after `xhost +`) or listening to my machine (after `xhost 192.168.42.85`) I can change the DISPLAY environment and connect my graphical output to that machine. In this case if I run a graphical program, its output (windows) will be shown on another machine:

````
$ export DISPLAY=192.168.42.85:0
$ xeyes # the eyes will be shown on 192.168.42.85 machine
````

> Note: This wont work if you test it on a modern machine. Most X11s do not listen on any port these days.
