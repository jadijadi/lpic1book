## LPIC 1 study guide in plain English

This book is originally released as a part of a series of free video tutorials for LPIC1 created by Jadi \(in Persian language\). But it is also possible to use it as a reference for self-study to prepare for LPIC1-101 & LPIC-102 exam.

I've tried to write a short, easy to understand but still comprehensive exam guide. I'm not a native English speaker be ready for some possible language flaws.

Enjoy!
