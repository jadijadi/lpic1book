Description: Candidates should be able to select, install and configure a boot manager.

## Objectives

* Providing alternative boot locations and backup boot options.
* Install and configure a boot loader such as GRUB Legacy.
* Perform basic configuration changes for GRUB 2.
* Interact with the boot loader

Terms and Utilities

* /boot/grub/menu.lst
* grub-install
* MBR
* superblock

### Boot overview

System starts from BIOS and will do a self test called POST. Then it will hand over the boot process to the first sector of master boot record \(MBR\).

> MBR is on track \(Cylinder\) 0, side \(Head\) 0 and Sector 1 of the first disk which defines CHS.

MBR is only 512bytes so we need a _smart bootloader_ to handle larger boot managers and even multiple systems. Some of these boot loaders are LILO, GRUB and GRUB2.

> Chain Loading is when a boot loaders, loads another boot loader. This is done when a linux bootloader needs to start a Windows system.

### LILO

**LILO** \(**LI**nux **LO**ader\) is the older of three main linux boot loaders and in new distributions it is not installed by default. Its configuration is in `/etc/lilo.conf`.

There is a command to generate an initial config: `/usr/sbin/liloconfig`.

```text
# Originally generated by liloconfig - modified by Ian Shields

# This allows booting from any partition on disks with more than 1024
# cylinders.
lba32

# Specifies the boot device (floppy)
boot=/dev/fd0

# Specifies the device that should be mounted as root.
# If the special name CURRENT is used, the root device is set to the
# device on which the root file system is currently mounted. If the root
# has been changed with  -r , the respective device is used. If the
# variable ROOT is omitted, the root device setting contained in the
# kernel image is used. It can be changed with the rdev program.
root=/dev/sda7

# Bitmap configuration for /boot/coffee.bmp
bitmap=/boot/coffee.bmp
bmp-colors=12,,11,15,,8
bmp-table=385p,100p,1,10
bmp-timer=38,2,13,1

# Enables map compaction:
# Tries to merge read requests for adjacent sectors into a single
# read request. This drastically reduces load time and keeps the map
# smaller. Using COMPACT is especially recommended when booting from a
# floppy disk.
compact

# Install the specified file as the new boot sector.
# LILO supports built in boot sectors, you only need
# to specify the type, choose one from 'text', 'menu' or 'bitmap'.
# new: install=bmp      old: install=/boot/boot-bmp.b
# new: install=text     old: install=/boot/boot-text.b
# new: install=menu     old: install=/boot/boot-menu.b or boot.b
# default: 'menu' is default, unless you have a bitmap= line
# Note: install=bmp must be used to see the bitmap menu.
# install=menu
install=bmp

# Specifies the number of _tenths_ of a second LILO should
# wait before booting the first image.  LILO
# doesn't wait if DELAY is omitted or if DELAY is set to zero.
# delay=20

# Prompt to use certain image. If prompt is specified without timeout,
# boot will not take place unless you hit RETURN. Timeout is in tenths of
# a second.
prompt
timeout=200

# Enable large memory mode.
large-memory

# Specifies the location of the map file. If MAP is
# omitted, a file /boot/map is used.
map=/boot/map

# Specifies the VGA text mode that should be selected when
# booting. The following values are recognized (case is ignored):
#   NORMAL  select normal 80x25 text mode.
#   EXTENDED  select 80x50 text mode. The word EXTENDED can be
#     abbreviated to EXT.
#   ASK  stop and ask for user input (at boot time).
#   <number>  use the corresponding text mode. A list of available modes
#     can be obtained by booting with  vga=ask  and pressing [Enter].
vga=normal

# Defines non-standard parameters for the specified disk.
#disk=/dev/sda
#    bios=0x80

# If you are using removable USB drivers (with mass-storage)
# you will need to tell LILO to not use these devices even
# if defined in /etc/fstab and referenced in /proc/partitions.
# Adjust these lines to your devices:
#
# disk=/dev/sda inaccessible
# disk=/dev/sdb inaccessible

# These images were automagically added. You may need to edit something.

image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.31-14-generic
    label="Lin 2.6.31-14"
    initrd=/boot/initrd.img-2.6.31-14-generic
    read-only

image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.31-20-generic
    label="Lin 2.6.31-20"
    initrd=/boot/initrd.img-2.6.31-20-generic
    read-only

image=/boot/memtest86+.bin
    label="Memory Test+"
    read-only

# If you have another OS on this machine (say DOS),
# you can boot if by uncommenting the following lines
# (Of course, change /dev/sda1 to wherever your DOS partition is.)
other=/dev/sda6
        label="Fedora 8"

 other=/dev/sda1
   label="Windows XP"
```

When this config file is created, we have to issue the `lilo` command to make the disk bootable:

> -v -v doubles the verbosity! You can have up to 5 `-v`s!

Now you can boot your system from that floppy and you will get a menu to choose one of the boot options.

These are some other LILO switches:

| switch | meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| -q | show information about the map file. map file is located at /boot/map and contains the boot configs |
| -R | boot the system on the next reboot only. Used for remote systems |
| -l | list information about the Kernel |
| -u | uninstall lilo and restore previous boot record |

Please note that pressing **TAB** when choosing an item in LILO menu, will let you edit that item.

### GRUB \(version 1 or the Legacy grub\)

**GRUB** \(**GR**and **U**nified **B**ootloader\) is a newer bootloader than LILO.

The GRUBv1 \(actually 0.9\) config file is in `/boot/grub/grub.conf` and most of the times `/boot/grub/menu.lst` is a symbolic link to it.

A sample grub.conf file for GRUB legacy is shown below.

```text
# grub.conf generated by anaconda
#
# Note that you do not have to rerun grub after making changes to this file
# NOTICE:  You do not have a /boot partition.  This means that
#          all kernel and initrd paths are relative to /, eg.
#          root (hd0,5)
#          kernel /boot/vmlinuz-version ro root=/dev/sda6
#          initrd /boot/initrd-version.img
#boot=/dev/sda6
default=1
timeout=10
splashimage=(hd0,5)/boot/grub/splash.xpm.gz
#hiddenmenu
password --md5 $1$RW1VW/$4XGAklxB7/GJk0uO47Srx1

      hd:UUID=8b4c62e7-2022-4288-8995-5eda92cd149b:/boot/upgrade/install.img \
      ks=hd:UUID=8b4c62e7-2022-4288-8995-5eda92cd149b:/boot/upgrade/ks.cfg
    initrd /boot/upgrade/initrd.img
title Fedora (2.6.26.8-57.fc8)
    root (hd0,5)
    kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.26.8-57.fc8 ro root=LABEL=FEDORA8 rhgb quiet
    initrd /boot/initrd-2.6.26.8-57.fc8.img
title Fedora (2.6.26.6-49.fc8)
    root (hd0,5)
    kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.26.6-49.fc8 ro root=LABEL=FEDORA8 rhgb quiet
    initrd /boot/initrd-2.6.26.6-49.fc8.img
title GRUB Menu
    rootnoverify (hd0,1)
    chainloader +1
title Windows
    rootnoverify (hd0,0)
    chainloader +1
```

As you can see the first part tells grub how it should behave and the second part is describing boot options \(OSs\).

There are options in this file:

| command | meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| \# | comment |
| default | the default system to boot; starts from 0 |
| timeout | how long to wait before autobooting |
| splashimage | background image |
| password | Security is important! will ask this password |
| title | Name of the entery |
| root | The partion to boot. Counting starts from 0. `root(hd0,2)` is the 3rd partion on the first disk |
| kernel | which kernel image should be loaded |
| initrd | the name of the initial RAM disk. Modules needed by the kernel before the file system is mounted |
| savedefault | remember the last booted item |
| chainloader | another file will act as stage 1 loader. Used for booting Windows systems |

#### GRUB \(legacy\) commands

After creating the configuration, you need to install the grub on a disk do this with one of these command forms:

```text
# grub-install /dev/fd0
# grub-install '(fd0)'
```

> As other boot managers, you can install grub on a CD, floppy, MBR \(/dev/sda, /dev/sdb, ..\) or a partition \(/dev/sdb2, /dev/sda6, ..\).

If you needed to change or reconfigure anything during the startup, just press the `e` on that item and you'll get an interactive editing environment. Press **Enter** when done and `b` for boot.

### GRUB2

This is the most common boot loader these days. Its main config file is `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` and can be created by `grub-mkconfig > /boot/grub/grub.cfg`. Grub also is highly dependent on a core.img file in /boot/grub.

When you run `grub-install /dev/sda`, grub2 builds a core image, build a configuration file and install GRUB 2 in your MBR.

These steps can be done separately:

```text
$ grub-install --help
Usage: grub-install [OPTION] install_device
Install GRUB on your drive.

  -h, --help              print this message and exit
  -v, --version           print the version information and exit
  --modules=MODULES       pre-load specified modules MODULES
  --root-directory=DIR    install GRUB images under the directory DIR
                          instead of the root directory
  --grub-setup=FILE       use FILE as grub-setup
  --grub-mkimage=FILE     use FILE as grub-mkimage
  --grub-mkdevicemap=FILE use FILE as grub-mkdevicemap
  --grub-probe=FILE       use FILE as grub-probe
  --no-floppy             do not probe any floppy drive
  --recheck               probe a device map even if it already exists
  --force                 install even if problems are detected
  --disk-module=MODULE    disk module to use

INSTALL_DEVICE can be a GRUB device name or a system device filename.

grub-install copies GRUB images into the DIR/boot directory specified by
--root-directory, and uses grub-setup to install grub into the boot
sector.

Report bugs to <bug-grub@gnu.org>.
```

> There is a command called `update-grub` as a frontend to `grub-mkconfig` which looks into the /etc/default/grub and creates a grub.cfg file.

Here is a sample of grub2 configuration file:

```text
### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/05_debian_theme ###                               
set menu_color_normal=white/black
set menu_color_highlight=black/white
### END /etc/grub.d/05_debian_theme ###                                 

### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/10_linux ###                                      
menuentry "Ubuntu, Linux 2.6.31-20-generic" {
        recordfail=1
        if [ -n ${have_grubenv} ]; then save_env recordfail; fi
        set quiet=1
        insmod ext2
        set root=(hd0,7)
        search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set 8954fa66-e11f-42dc-91f0-b4aa480fa103

        initrd  /boot/initrd.img-2.6.31-20-generic
}

         root=UUID=8954fa66-e11f-42dc-91f0-b4aa480fa103 ro single
        initrd  /boot/initrd.img-2.6.31-20-generic
