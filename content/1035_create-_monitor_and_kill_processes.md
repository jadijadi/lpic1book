## Managing processes
### foreground and background jobs

One of the great points of Linux even from its beginning days is the ability to run different programs and jobs at the same time. This is done by sending programs to the background.

Normally if you run a program on the terminal, it _blocks_ your terminal while it's running, but sending a command to the background will prevent this:

```
xeyes &
```

Even when a program is running normally in the foreground, you can do two things:
- break it using `Ctrl+c`
- *suspend* or pause it using `Ctrl+z`

A *stopped* job can be brought to the foreground using `fg` command (or the background using `bg`). You can also list all the jobs by the `jobs` command.

```
$ xeyes
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 xeyes
$ jobs
[1]+  Stopped                 xeyes
$ bg
[1]+ xeyes &
$ jobs
[1]+  Running                 xeyes &
$ sleep 1000 &
[2] 7395
$ jobs
[1]-  Running                 xeyes &
[2]+  Running                 sleep 1000 &
$ fg %2
sleep 1000
^Z
[2]+  Stopped                 sleep 1000
$ jobs
[1]-  Running                 xeyes &
[2]+  Stopped                 sleep 1000
$ bg sle
[2]+ sleep 1000 &
$ jobs
[1]-  Running                 xeyes &
[2]+  Running                 sleep 1000 &
`
```

> `jobs -l ` also shows the process ID of jobs

### nohup

The `nohup` command lets you run your commands even after you close the terminal or logout. By default, it writes its output to `nohup.out`:

```
$ nohup ping 4.2.2.4
nohup: ignoring input and appending output to ‘nohup.out’
^C$ cat nohup.out
PING 4.2.2.4 (4.2.2.4) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 4.2.2.4: icmp_seq=1 ttl=51 time=225 ms
64 bytes from 4.2.2.4: icmp_seq=3 ttl=51 time=223 ms

--- 4.2.2.4 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 2 received, 50% packet loss, time 3010ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 223.584/224.767/225.950/1.183 ms
```

> It is common to use `2>` to redirect the nohup errors to another file and use a `&` to run it in the background: `nohup script.sh > mynohup.out 2>&1 &` 

### kill

Despite its frightening name, the `kill` command sends unix *signals* to processes. Pressing `Ctrl+c` and `Ctrl+z` is also sending signals. By default, the `kill` command sends the signal **15** (which is TERM and tells to process to terminate itself).

```
$ jobs
[3]   Running                 xeyes &
[4]   Running                 sleep 1000 &
[5]-  Running                 sleep 2000 &
[6]+  Running                 sleep 3000 &
$ kill %4
$ jobs
[3]   Running                 xeyes &
[4]   Terminated              sleep 1000
[5]-  Running                 sleep 2000 &
[6]+  Running                 sleep 3000 &
$ jobs
[3]   Running                 xeyes &
[5]-  Running                 sleep 2000 &
[6]+  Running                 sleep 3000 &
```

It is also possible to use PIDs instead of job numbers and kill other signals. The general format is `kill -SIGNAL_ID_OR_NAME process_id`:

| signal number | signal name | meaning |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| 1 | HUP | Informing the process that it's controlling terminal \(like an ssh connection\) is terminated |
| 15 | TERM | normal termination request |
| 9 | KILL | forcefully kills the process |

</br>

So you can do a `kill -9 8733` to force process ID 8733 to close.

> Remember the `nohup` command ? :) It means "do not respond to the hup signal".

### killall

This command Will send the given signal \(or by default 15\) to all processes with the given name:

```
$ jobs
[3]   Running                 xeyes &
[5]-  Running                 sleep 2000 &
[6]+  Running                 sleep 3000 &
$ ps -ef | grep sleep
jadi      7864  7651  0 21:07 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep 2000
jadi      7865  7651  0 21:07 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep 3000
jadi      7977  7651  0 21:14 pts/1    00:00:00 grep sleep
$ killall sleep
[5]-  Terminated              sleep 2000
[6]+  Terminated              sleep 3000
$ jobs
[3]+  Running                 xeyes &
$ ps -ef | grep sleep
jadi      7980  7651  0 21:14 pts/1    00:00:00 grep sleep
```

### pkill

Will send the given signal \(or 15\) to all the processes with a specific pattern in their name:

```
$ jobs
[3]   Running                 xeyes &
[5]-  Running                 sleep 2000 &
[6]+  Running                 sleep 3000 &
$ ps -ef | grep sleep
jadi      7864  7651  0 21:07 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep 2000
jadi      7865  7651  0 21:07 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep 3000
jadi      7977  7651  0 21:14 pts/1    00:00:00 grep sleep
$ pkill sle
[5]-  Terminated              sleep 2000
[6]+  Terminated              sleep 3000
$ jobs
[3]+  Running                 xeyes &
$ ps -ef | grep sleep
jadi      7980  7651  0 21:14 pts/1    00:00:00 grep sleep
```

## Monitoring Processes
### ps

The `ps` command shows running processes on your computer. Each process has a process ID shown as **PID** and a Parent Process ID shown as PPID.

```
$ sleep 1000 &
[1] 7678
$ sleep 1001 &
[2] 7679
$ xeyes &
[3] 7680
$ ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 7651 pts/1    00:00:00 bash
 7678 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep
 7679 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep
 7680 pts/1    00:00:00 xeyes
 7681 pts/1    00:00:00 ps
```

Two common switch combination is `ps aux` (or `-aux`) and `ps ef` which shows ALL processes on a system:

```
$ ps -aux | wc -l
293
```


It is also possible to use the `--sort` switch to sort the output based on different fields \(+ for ascending & - for descending\).

```
$ ps -af --sort +comm,-sid
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root      5486  5478  0 19:59 pts/12   00:00:00 -su
root      4444  1169  0 19:56 tty4     00:00:00 -bash
jadi      6638  5412  0 20:10 pts/0    00:00:04 node /usr/local/bin/sslocal
jadi      7778  7651  0 20:58 pts/1    00:00:00 ps -af --sort +comm,-sid
jadi      7678  7651  0 20:48 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep 1000
jadi      7679  7651  0 20:48 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep 1001
jadi      7775  7651  0 20:58 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep 1000
jadi      7776  7651  0 20:58 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep 1000
jadi      7777  7651  0 20:58 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep 1000
root      5478  5477  0 19:59 pts/12   00:00:00 su -
root      5477  5008  0 19:59 pts/12   00:00:00 sudo su -
jadi      7680  7651  0 20:48 pts/1    00:00:01 xeyes
```


### pgrep
You've seen that `ps -ef` shows processes from all users. We can `grep` on that and see who is running `gedit` and what is its process ID:

```
$ ps -ef | grep gedit
jadi      6213  4604  9 20:06 ?        00:04:43 gedit
jadi      7725  7651  0 20:55 pts/1    00:00:00 grep gedit
```

but there is also a more direct way to check the PID of all gedit processes:

```
$ pgrep gedit 
6213
```

### top
This is the most common tool to do simple monitoring of the system. It will update the status and will give you a good glance at the status:

```
$top

You can see the processes, system load, uptime, CPU status, memory, ... and do some stuff:

| key during top | functionality |
| :---: | :--- |
| h | help |
| q | quit |
| M | sort based on memory usage |
| c | show full commands |
| k | kill after asking pid and signal |

### free
The `free` command will show you info about the system memory. The default is _kilobytes_, but you can change it with `-m` for megabytes, `-g` for _gigabytes_ or even `-b` for bytes. You can also use the `-h` for **human-readable**. 

```
$ free -m
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          7871       5231       2640        332        169       2195
-/+ buffers/cache:       2866       5005
Swap:         7627          0       7627
```

> A general **hint**: If your system is using Swap, you have memory issues.

### uptime
The `uptime` command shows the time, system's uptime (how long the system has been running), how many users are logged in, and the load average of 1, 5 & 15 minutes:

```
$ uptime
 21:18:52 up  1:34,  5 users,  load average: 2.38, 2.64, 2.41
```

> Although it's one of the most important KPIs of the system status, some of the experienced Linux admins do not know what the load average means. The load average shows how many processes are in the **to be run** queue. If this number is higher than the number of your CPU cores, you are in a bad situation. If it's close to the number of your cores constantly, it's kind of dangerous, and if it's less than 1/10th of your core numbers, your system is kind of idle. Do you remember how to check the number of your cores? It's in `/proc/cpuinfo` or `nproc`.

### watch
Sometimes you have a command which shows you an output, but you want to keep running it and observing the output. In these cases, the `watch` is your friend. It lets you run and check the output of a command in specific time intervals (default is 2 seconds). 

```
$ watch free -h
```

If you have a pipe in your command, you have to quote the watched command in double-quote `"` or single-quote `'`:

```
$ watch "ls -ltrh | wc -l"
```

These are some of the switches:

- `-n` To specify the interval in seconds
- `-b` Beep if the command has a non-zero exit
- `-d` Shows the difference between runs

## Terminal Multiplexers
### screen
If you are used to GUI based system, it's easy to run different terminals side to side and use them to run different programs. But if you are on a server, you need other tools to multiplex your terminal. One such command is `screen`. 

Run it with `screen` and press enter to exit the welcome window into a prompt. You can use it as a normal terminal and detach from it (and let it run in the background) using the Ctrl + A and then D keys. Check the list of your screens with `screen -ls` and re-attach to any of them with `screen -r screen-id`. 

Below you can see a few common switches, they all should be issued after the `Ctrl + A` combination.

| Key | Usage |
|:---:|---|
|\\ |Kill all processes windows and terminate the screen|
|\||Split current window into two vertical focuses|
|Shift+S|Split current window into two horizontal focuses|
|C|Create a window in the current focus|
|Tab|Go to the next focus|
|D|Detach from window|
|K|Kill current window|
|N|Move to Next window|
|P|Move to the Previous window|

A great point about screen (and tmux) is the fact it remains running even after you logout of the system, and it's possible to relogin and re-attach to the same screen (or tmux)

### tmux
Is a screen on steroids! It is not installed by default in most distributions, and you have to install it first. The default command prefix is `Ctrl+B` and after running the `tmux new` you can issue these:

|Key|Usage|
|:---:|---|
|%|Split current window vertically|
|"|Split current window horizontally|
|D|Detach from the current window|
|&|Kill current window|

You can list the tmux sessions using `tmux ls` and re-attach to one using `tmux att` to connect to the last one or `tmux att -t session_name` to attach to a specific one.

> I highly recommend being fluent in tmux. It's super useful even when you are working locally on your machine. watch the below video for the more in-depth session:
