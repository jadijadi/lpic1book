## du & df

In many cases you want to find out about the free space of a disk or find how much space a directory is using or check how many inodes left.

> The inode (index node) is a data structure in a Unix-style file system that describes a file-system object, such as a file or a directory. Each inode stores the attributes and disk block locations of the object's data. File-system object attributes may include metadata (times of last change, access, modification), as well as owner and permission data. A directory is a list of inodes with their assigned names. The list includes an entry for itself, its parent, and each of its children. <small>([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode))</small>

### df

The **d**isk**f**ree command is used to find out about the free and used space on file systems.

```text
jadi@funlife:~$ df -TH
Filesystem        Type      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda2         ext4       23G   15G  7.7G  65% /
none              tmpfs     4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
udev              devtmpfs  3.9G  4.0K  3.9G   1% /dev
tmpfs             tmpfs     788M  1.4M  786M   1% /run
none              tmpfs     5.0M  4.0K  5.0M   1% /run/lock
none              tmpfs     3.9G   19M  3.9G   1% /run/shm
none              tmpfs     100M   28K  100M   1% /run/user
/dev/mapper/chome ext4      243G  229G   14G  95% /home/jadi
/dev/sdb1         vfat      3.7G  7.8M  3.6G   1% /media/jadi/BA82-BECD
```

Here, the `-T` switch tells `df` to show the file system types and \`-H\` make numbers human-readable (in powers of 1000, for powers of 2, use `-h`).

On some filesystems (like ext2-4) we have a fixed number of inodes, so you may need to check the number of remaining inodes too. To do so, use the `-i` switch:

```text
jadi@funlife:~$ df -i
Filesystem          Inodes  IUsed    IFree IUse% Mounted on
/dev/sda2          1531904 458616  1073288   30% /
none               1007533      4  1007529    1% /sys/fs/cgroup
udev               1003703    542  1003161    1% /dev
tmpfs              1007533    644  1006889    1% /run
none               1007533      3  1007530    1% /run/lock
none               1007533    162  1007371    1% /run/shm
none               1007533     33  1007500    1% /run/user
/dev/mapper/chome 16171008 269293 15901715    2% /home/jadi
/dev/sdb1                0      0        0     - /media/jadi/BA82-BECD
```

> vfat file format has no inodes; there is no owner or access rights on vfat filesystems.

### du

The **d**isk**u**sage command shows the used space of **directories and files**. The common switches are:

| switch | usage |
| :---: | :--- |
| -h | print sizes in powers of 1024 \(e.g., 1023M\) |
| -H | print sizes in powers of 1000 \(e.g., 1.1G\) |
| -c | show the grand total |
| --max-depth 2 | Calculate all but show only 2 directories deep |
| -s | Only shows the summary and not all the directories one by one |

```text
jadi@funlife:~/w/lpic$ du
16    ./101
701456    ./done
701464    ./Logo/chert
704588    ./Logo
12    ./data
12    ./100
9432884    .
jadi@funlife:~/w/lpic$ du -c
16    ./101

9432884    .
9432884    total
jadi@funlife:~/w/lpic$ du -hs
9.0G    .
```

> in many cases when I want to see what uses my servers space, I use something like `$sudo du /home -h --max-depth 1`

## checking file systems

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VjnBzwDYbIY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### fsck

If anything bad happens for your filesystem \(say power suddenly goes down\) you will have a corrupted file system. The general command to fix this is `fsck`. Technically, this command is a front end for many commands:

```text
jadi@funlife:~$ ls /sbin/*fsck*
/sbin/dosfsck       /sbin/fsck.ext2     /sbin/fsck.fat     /sbin/fsck.vfat
/sbin/e2fsck       /sbin/fsck.ext3     /sbin/fsck.minix
/sbin/fsck       /sbin/fsck.ext4     /sbin/fsck.msdos
/sbin/fsck.cramfs  /sbin/fsck.ext4dev  /sbin/fsck.nfs
```

> Some of these are just hardlinks to `e2fsck` command

A common switch during boot is `-A` which tells `fsck` to check all file systems in /etc/fstab ordered by _passno_ in that file which is 6th field \(File systems with _passno_ of 0, won't be checked during the boot\).

```text
root@funlife:~# fsck /dev/sdb
fsck from util-linux 2.25.1
e2fsck 1.42.10 (18-May-2014)
/dev/sdb is in use.
e2fsck: Cannot continue, aborting.


root@funlife:~# umount /dev/sdb
umount: /dev/sdb: not mounted
root@funlife:~# umount /dev/sdb1
root@funlife:~# fsck /dev/sdb
fsck from util-linux 2.25.1
e2fsck 1.42.10 (18-May-2014)
ext2fs_open2: Bad magic number in super-block
fsck.ext2: Superblock invalid, trying backup blocks...
fsck.ext2: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/sdb

The superblock could not be read or does not describe a valid ext2/ext3/ext4
filesystem.  If the device is valid and it really contains an ext2/ext3/ext4
filesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock
is corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock:
    e2fsck -b 8193 <device>
 or
    e2fsck -b 32768 <device>
```

You can also check filesystems with UUID \(find them with `blkid` command or with labels\) :

```text
root@funlife:~# fsck /dev/sdb
fsck from util-linux 2.25.1
e2fsck 1.42.10 (18-May-2014)
ext2fs_open2: Bad magic number in super-block
fsck.ext2: Superblock invalid, trying backup blocks...
fsck.ext2: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/sdb

The superblock could not be read or does not describe a valid ext2/ext3/ext4
filesystem.  If the device is valid and it really contains an ext2/ext3/ext4
filesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock
is corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock:
    e2fsck -b 8193 <device>
 or
    e2fsck -b 32768 <device>

root@funlife:~# blkid
/dev/sda1: LABEL="movies"
/dev/sdb1: UUID="BA82-BECD" TYPE="vfat" PARTUUID="381add66-01"
root@funlife:~# fsck LABEL=movies
fsck from util-linux 2.25.1
root@funlife:~# fsck UUID="BA82-BECD"
fsck from util-linux 2.25.1
fsck.fat 3.0.26 (2014-03-07)
/dev/sdb1: 14 files, 1972/945094 clusters
```

Use `-N` to see what command/test is going to be executed without actually running them:

```text
root@funlife:~# fsck -N UUID="BA82-BECD"
fsck from util-linux 2.25.1
[/sbin/fsck.vfat (1) -- /dev/sdb1] fsck.vfat /dev/sdb1
```

> If you want to check a XFS filesystem, you have to use `xfs_check` command

Some version do have a `-a` for automatic fixing all found issues, but it's not recommended. 
### e2fsck

`e2fsck` is used to check the ext2/ext3/ext4 family of file systems.  For ext3 and ext4 file systems that use a `journal`, if the system has been shutdown uncleanly without any errors, normally, after replaying the committed transactions in the journal, the file system should be marked as clean. Hence, for file systems that use **journaling**, e2fsck will normally replay the journal and exit, unless its superblock indicates that further checking is required.

device is a block device (e.g., `/dev/sdc1`) or file containing the file system.

Note that in general, it is not safe to run `e2fsck` on  ***mounted*** file systems.  The only exception is if the `-n` option is specified, and `-c`, `-l`, or `-L` options are not specified. However, even if it is safe to do so, the results printed by `e2fsck` are not valid if the file system is ***mounted***. If `e2fsck` asks whether you should check a file system which is mounted or not, the only correct answer is `no`. Only experts who really know what they are doing should consider answering this question in any other way.

If `e2fsck` is run in interactive mode (meaning that none of `-y`, `-n`, or `-p` are specified), the program will ask the user to fix each problem found in the file system. A response of `'y'` will fix the error; `'n'` will leave the error unfixed; and `'a'` will fix the problem and all subsequent problems; pressing Enter will proceed with the default response, which is printed before the question mark.  Pressing `Control-C` terminates `e2fsck` immediately.

### mke2fs
mke2fs is used to create an ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystem, usually in a disk partition. device is the special file corresponding to the device (e.g /dev/hdXX). blocks-count is the number of blocks on the device. If omitted, mke2fs automagically figures the file system size. If called as mkfs.ext3, a journal is created as if the `-j` option was specified.

The defaults of the parameters for the newly created filesystem, if not overridden by the options listed below, are controlled by the /etc/mke2fs.conf configuration file. See the mke2fs.conf(5) manual page for more details.

### tune2fs

This is a command to tune _ext_ file systems. It can show information and set many options. The `-l` option lists the current configs:

```text
jadi@funlife:~$ sudo tune2fs -l /dev/sda2

### debugfs

This is an interactive tool for debug an ext filesystem. It opens the filesystem in read-only mode unless we tell it not to \(with `-w` option\). It can un-delete files and directories.

```text
root@funlife:~# debugfs /dev/sda2

```

#### Superblock

Unix systems use superblocks to save _filesystem metadata_. Most of the time this block is located at the beginning of the file system and replicated on other locations too. The `-n` of `mke2fs` displays superblock locations

```text
# mke2fs -n /dev/sda7
mke2fs 1.41.9 (22-Aug-2009)
Filesystem label=
OS type: Linux
Block size=4096 (log=2)
Fragment size=4096 (log=2)
7159808 inodes, 28637862 blocks
1431893 blocks (5.00%) reserved for the super user
First data block=0
Maximum filesystem blocks=4294967296
874 block groups
32768 blocks per group, 32768 fragments per group
8192 inodes per group
Superblock backups stored on blocks:
    32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208,
    4096000, 7962624, 11239424, 20480000, 23887872
```


## xfs tools

Note: in some distros, xfs tools are not installed by default, and you might need to install `xfsprogs` package. 

This is same as the `tune2fs`, but for xfs file systems.

> xfs_info should be used on mounted file systems

| Command | usage |
| :---: | :--- |
| xfs_info | display information |
| xfs_growfs | expand file system |
| xfs_admin | change parameters on XFS file systems |
| xfs_repair | repair the problems. Please note that the filesytem under repair should be unmounted |
| xfs_db | checks and debug the filesystem. xfs_db is used to examine an XFS filesystem. Under rare circumstances, it can also be used to modify an XFS filesystem, but that task is normally left to xfs_repair or to scripts such as xfs_admin that run xfs_db. |
| xfs_fsr | filesystem reorganizer for XFS. When invoked with no arguments xfs_fsr reorganizes all regular files in all mounted filesystems. xfs_fsr makes many cycles over /etc/mtab each time making a single pass over each XFS filesystem. Each pass goes through and selects files that have the largest number of extents. It attempts to defragment the top 10% of these files on each pass. |



### Repairing

We used the `fsck` for showing file system information, but it is designed to _fix_ file systems too. If the boot time check find a problem, you will be put into a command line to fix the problems.

On non-journaling file systems \(ext2\) the fsck will show you many questions about each block, and you have to say `y` if you want it to fix them. On journaling file systems \(ext3&4, xfs, ...\) the fsck has much fewer tasks to perform.

> For xfs file systems, we have `xfs_check` command

An important switch is `-n` which causes these commands **not to fix** anything and just show what was going to be done.


## Other tools

For the LPIC exam, it is good to know about these commands.

| filesystem | command | usage |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| ext | tune2fs | Show or set ext2 and ext3 parameters or even set the journaling options |
| ext | dumpe2fs | Prints the super block and block group descriptor information for an ext2 or ext3 filesystem. |
| ext | debugfs | It's an interactive file system debugger. Use it to examine or change the state of an ext2 or ext3file system. |
| reiserfs | reiserfstune | show and set parameters |
| reiserfs | debugreiserfs | Prints the super block and block group descriptor information for an ext2 or ext3 filesystem. |
| XFS | xfs\_info | display information |
| XFS | xfs\_growfs | expand file system |
| XFS | xfs\_admin | change parameters on XFS file systems |
| XFS | xfs\_repair | repair the problems |
| XFS | xfs\_db | checks and debugs the filesystem |
