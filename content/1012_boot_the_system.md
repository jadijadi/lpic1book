## The Boot Process
It is important to understand because at this stage, you have very little control over the system and you can not issue commands to troubleshoot much. You should have a good understanding of what is happening.

1. Motherboard Firmware does a PowerOnSelfTest
2. Motherboard loads the bootloader
3. Bootloader loads the Linux Kernel-based on its configs/commands
4. The Kernel loads and prepares the system (root filesystem) and runs the initialization program
5. Init program start the service, other programs, ... (web server, graphical interface, networking, etc.)

As we discussed in the previous section (101.1), the Firmware on the motherboard can be BIOS or UEFI. 

### BIOS
Basic Input Output System

- Older
- Limited to one sector of the disk and needs a multi-stage bootloader
- Can start the bootloader from internal/external HDD, CD/DVD, USB Flash drive, Network server
- If booting from the HDD, the Master Boot Record will be used (1 sector)

### UEFI
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. 

- Modern and fancy
- Specifies a special disk partition for the bootloader. Called EFI System Partition (ESP)
- ESP is FAT and mounted on `/boot/efi` and bootloader files has .efi extensions

> You can check `/sys/firmware/efi` to see if you are using a UEFI system or not

### Bootloader
Bootloader initializes the minimum hardware needed to boot the system and then finds and runs the OS.

Technically you can point your UEFI to run anything you want but typically under GNU/Linux systems, we use GRUB. Even the GRUB can be used to run any specific program you need but generally it runs the OS. 

### Kernel

The Kernel is the core of your operating system, the LINUX itself. Your bootloader loads the kernel in the memory and runs it. But kernel needs some initial info to start; Things like drivers are necessary to work with the hardware. Those are stored in `initrd` or `initramfs` alongside the kernel and used during the boot. 

You can also send parameters to the kernel during the boot using the Grub configs. For example, sending a 1 or S will result the system booting in single-user mode (recovery). Or you can force your graphics to work in 1024Ã—768x24 mode by passing `vga=792` to the Kernel during the boot.

#### dmesg

Linux will show you the boot process logs during the boot. Some desktop systems hide this behind a fancy boot splash which you can hide using the Esc key or press Ctrl+Alt+F1.

> **Fun Fact:** During the bootup, only The Kernel is running so it should record and keep its logs!

dmesg command will show the full data from **kernel ring buffer** up to now. But

```text
cat /var/log/dmesg
```

will show **only** the data during the boot.

We can also you `journalctl -k` to check Kernel logs or use `journalctl -b` to check for boot logs (Or even use `journalctl -u kernel` to see all previous logs too).

In addition to these, most systems keep the boot logs in a text-like file too. Under Debian-based systems, it's called `/var/log/boot` and for RedHat-based systems, it's `/var/log/boot.log`.

#### /var/log/messages

After the init process comes up, syslog daemon will log messages. It has timestamps and will persist during restarts.

* The Kernel is still logging its messages in dmesg
* in some systems, it might be called `/var/log/syslog`
* there are many other logs at `/var/log`

## init

When the Kernel finished its initialization, its time to start other programs. To do so, the Kernel runs the Initialization Daemon process, and it takes care of starting other daemons, services, subsystems and programs. Using the init system one can say "I need service A and then service B. Then I need C and D and E but do not start D unless the A and B are running". The system admin can use the init system to stop and start the services later.

There are different init systems:

- **SysVinit** is based on Unix System V. Not being used much but people loved it and you may see it on older machines or even on recently installed ones
- **systemd** is the new replacement. Some people hate it but it is being used by all the major distros. Can start services in parallel and do lots of fancy stuff! 
- **upstart** was an event-based replacement for the traditional init daemon. The project was started in 2014 by Canonical (the company behind Ubuntu) to replace the SysV but did not continue after 2015 and Ubuntu is now using the systemd as its init system.

The init process had the ID of 1 and you can find it by running the 

```
# which init
/sbin/init
# readlink -f /sbin/init
/usr/lib/systemd/systemd
# ps -p 1
PID TTY TIME     CMD
1   ?   00:00:06 systemd
```
 
You can check the hierarchy of processes using the `pstree` command.

```text
pstree
```

## systemd
Is new, loved, and hated. Lots of new ideas but not following some of the beloved UNIX principles (say.. not saving logs in a text file or trying to help you too much but asking for the root password when you are not running commands with sudo). It lets us run services if the hardware is connected, in time intervals, if another service is started, and ...

The systemd is made around **unit**s. A unit can be a service, group of services, or an action. Units do have a name, a type, and a configuration file. There are 12 unit types: automount, device, mount, path, scope, service, slice, snapshot, socket, swap, target & timer.

We use `systemctl` to work with these units and `journalctl` to see the logs.

```
# systemctl list-units
# systemctl list-units --type=target
# systemctl get-default # default target (groups of services are started via target unit files)
```

The units can be found in these places (sorted by priority):

1. `/etc/systemd/system/`
2. `/run/systemd/system/`
3. `/usr/lib/systemd/system`

```
# systemctl list-unit-files
# systemctl cat ntpd.service
# systemctl cat graphical.target
```

We can use these commands to work with services:

```
# systemctl stop sshd
# systemctl start sshd
# systemctl status sshd
# systemctl is-active sshd
# systemctl is-failed sshd
# systemctl restart sshd
# systemctl reload sshd # re-reads the configuration of the service configs
# systemctl daemon-reload sshd # re-reads the configuration of the systemd configs of this service
# systemctl enable sshd
# systemctl disable sshd
```

there are other commands too:

```
# systemctl is-system-running # running, degraded, maintenance, initializing, starting, stopping
# systemctl --failed
```

to check the logs, we have to use the `journalctl` utility:

```
# journalctl # show all journal
# journalctl --no-pager # do not use less
# journalctl -n 10 # only 10 lines
# journalctl -S -1d # last 1 day
# journalctl -xe # last few logs
# journalctl -u ntp # only ntp unit
# journalctl _PID=1234
```

## SysV
Is the older init system. Still can be used on many systems. The control files are located at `/etc/init.d/` and are closer to the general bash scripts. In many cases you can call like:

```
/etc/init.d/ntpd status
/etc/init.d/ntpd stop
/etc/init.d/ntpd start
/etc/init.d/ntpd restart
```

We will speak more about runlevels on 101.3.
