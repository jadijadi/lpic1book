Watching videos or even reading books is never enough. You need to have Linux installed and practice your newly acquired knowledge. As you may know, LPIC is a *distro agnostic* test and an LPIC-certified guru should be able to work in any GNU/Linux system, or at least on the major ones. Because of this, I suggest you have two Linux machines which you can work on. One RPM-based and one Debian-based. 

One common way is to use a Virtual Machine. You can install something like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) (for Win/Linux and Intel Macs) or [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app) (for M1 Macs) or any other solution to install your test machines in a Virtual Machine. 

For your distribution, I suggest [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) or [Debian](https://www.debian.org) as your Debian-based system and [Fedora](https://getfedora.org) or [Rocky Linux](https://rockylinux.org) as your RPM-based machine. Feel free to install anything else and do whatever you enjoy!

If you want to walk in my steps, do a normal GUI installation. Here is me, installing the Ubuntu 22.04:

And here, you can follow the Fedora 36 installation:

Note: The version is not that important. Here I'm installing Fedora 36 & Ubuntu 22.04.
